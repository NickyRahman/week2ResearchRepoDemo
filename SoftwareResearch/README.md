# IT5016 Software Development Fundamentals
##
This repository will track the progress of the Final Project of the IT5016: Software Development Fundamentals Course
This repository will act as a diary that will contain notes, comments, and codes used to create the final project.

For the final Project of this course, I have decided to explore Python coding to create simple graphic visualizations. I looked around the internet for tutorials that were simple enough for me to understand and follow. I created about 9 python graphic programs which then were run by one python program that allowed for each of the graphic codes to run sequentially.

Also included in this folder is the Pseudocode & flowchart assignment - for a simple Cat and Dog Program.
