### What is visual programming?

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
Recently I made my first game in Scratch : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/722400091
This was a lot of fun probably because it was visually immediate to see. And the overall learning curve was pretty good.
The coding process was easy as all the codes were there and it was just like working on a jigsaw puzzle.
