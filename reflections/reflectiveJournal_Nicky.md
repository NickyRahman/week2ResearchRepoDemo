# Reflective Journal

## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
What is Scratch explain?
Image result for what is scratch
Scratch is the world's largest coding community for children and a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital stories, games, and animations. Scratch is designed, developed, and moderated by the Scratch Foundation, a nonprofit organization.

### What is visual programming?
Visual programming is a programming language that lets humans describe processes using illustration. Whereas a typical text-based programming language makes the programmer think like a computer, a visual programming language enables the programmer to describe the process in terms that make sense to humans.

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
1. Keep It Simple, Stupid: most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex - Less code takes less time to write, has less bugs, and is easier to modify.
2. 

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
Recently I made my first game in Scratch : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/722400091
This was a lot of fun probably because it was visually immediate to see. And the overall learning curve was pretty good.
The coding process was easy as all the codes were there and it was just like working on a jigsaw puzzle.

## Week 2:

### What is git?
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 
While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.
I am also including the various youtube links I have been using to learn more about the topics covered in this class:

## Week 3:

### What is Visual Studio Code?
Visual Studio Code (famously known as VS Code) is a free open source text editor by Microsoft. VS Code is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Although the editor is relatively lightweight, it includes some powerful features that have made VS Code one of the most popular development environment tools in recent times.

Will install VS Code sometime this week. Not looking forward to this. It has been a steep learning curve with Python.

I am also including the various websites that I have found useful in learning more about Python:

**Python**

https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html

https://www.w3schools.com/python/

## Week 4:

### What is Videograph?
THis week was quite interesting. We learned about videograph. Roman asked us all to do a short recording of others based on several requirements. Then we had to show the video by all of us putting it down on the floor and playing the video at the same time. 
##



## Week 5:

### What is Stand-up?
Today we learned a little about a meeting tool called stand-up. A stand-up meeting (stum) is a meeting in which attendees typically participate while standing. The discomfort of standing for long periods is intended to keep the meetings short. 

The daily stand-up meeting (also known as a "daily scrum", a "daily huddle", "morning roll-call", etc.) is simple to describe:
The whole team meets every day for a quick status update. We stand up to keep the meeting short.
That's it.

We used this tool to briefly share idea(s) we have for our final project. 

### Blockchain

Another new term we learned this week was **Blockchain**

Blockchain defined: Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).


### Agile

We also built a tower made of spagetti sticks and ONE marshmellow! That was fun and stressful! Roman spoek about working from the top-down. Meaning setting up the load (at the top), then looking at how we culd support the load. This is the concept behind **Agile**.

**The Agile methodology** is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating.

I am going to start another commit that focuses on my final project which will be a python-based game. I will be referring to a tutorial online.
##



## Week 6:
Looking forward to learning this week! Spent the weekend practicing basic Python exercises.
I think I am getting the hang of it. But I really need to spend at least 2 hours a day to keep practicing or I will forget the language!

### Python Koan (pronounced (Koh-uhnn)
Python Koans is an interactive tutorial for learning the Python programming language by making tests pass. Most tests are fixed by filling the missing parts of assert functions. According to a Google site, In Zen Buddhism, a koan is a surprising and often perplexing phrase that's used as a meditation tool. A well-known koan is *"What is the sound of one hand clapping?"*

It's common in Zen Buddhist training for a teacher to present a koan to a student, often in the form of a question. Because of their paradoxical nature, koans are nearly impossible to answer, and students are expected to "sit with" them while meditating. Ideally, the koan eventually leads to enlightenment — and at the very least, it challenges the mind. The Japanese koān means *"public matter for thought."*

Today's lesson was very interesting. And really difficult to wrap my heard around. Trying to learn python by solving problems we didn't really understand. Or kind of did, but yeah... I think Pythoan Koan felt like reverse engineering a bit.. where you are given riddles with hints and you need to figure them out.

I finally installed VSCode and Python on my laptop. 
Will try and reproduce the steps we went through class today. Best of luck to me!!


### Software Project
I have given this more thought. SInce we are not required to do coding as part of the project, I am thinking of exploring **FIGMA** for games and web development.
I will spend some time today and tomorrow looking at videos and tutorials about FIGMA.


### Koan Progress
Completed 32 Koans today!!! 
Considering i started out around 2pm with struggling to run the program, and fumbling around trying to figure it, reaching out to Roman, and finally figuring out how all this works! 
I still don't know what I am doing with the Koans. The earlier lessons were easier because I have been doing som ebasic python exercises. But now that I am in Lesson 3, it is getting very confuding. Sometimes I can kind of understand. I see the pattern. Sometimes it's just lucky guesses. Other times I force mistakes so I can get a hint from the error generated in the terminal. LOL!
Also did a ste-by-step tutorial for some friends who were still trying to figure out how to get the python file running in VS Code.


Also.. a MEME
![Coding Meme1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110507439/187431881-f9f06db3-f8ef-4b04-9715-2f1cdba8b27c.png)



### Reflective_prompts
So I have not been paying attention to the Canvas announcement. Luckily my classmate informed me of the reflective_promts.md repo set by Roman. I spent the day completing this task. It was very daunting and challenging. There was a lot of reading, and researching.


### Submission of Repository Assignment
Dedicated the day to finishing the assignment. 
Spent much of the day practicing Python which I included in the repository. 
These are codes based on the tasks we were required to complete in Week 3/4 of the course.

And usual, I am ending this with memes. ENJOY!!

## Week 7:

###Final Software Project
This week Roman talked about jumpstarting our Final software project. I have had SO MANY IDEAS, it is ridiculous!! For weeks I have been jumping between one idea to another.... I want to do a website, I want to try out making a game, I want to do scripting!! 
But looking at the time I have on hand, I might do something I am more familiar with - python scripting for graphics.
I had done some basic tutorials using Python turtle ages ago. I think it's time i pick it up again, brushed the dust and give it another try.
The plan is to write up some simple scripts that generate simple graphics. For the final presentation, I plan to write up about 10 scripts and let them loop.
##


## Week 8:

### Final Software Project
Progress - I have completed a series of simple python scripts that generates graphic visuals. Although these are all based on existing tutorials, I am quite happy with them, and I think I learned a lot as I broke down each line to understand what I was typing.
I spent some time looking for ways to compile them and automate the script so they could play sequentially. I finally found one online, and decided to test it out by editing the script to read my files. I am still trying to fogire out how to control the start and end of the play. Hopefully I can get it done by submission date.

###Pseudo-code
This week Roman talked about Pseudocode and what they do. So what is pseudocode?
Pseudocode is the way of expressing a program or code so that it could be easily understood by programmers of every programming languages out there.
                 *Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or an algorithm

The purpose of writing a pseudocode is that it is easier for people to understand and interpret, than any specific programming language code. There is no standard pseudocode syntax required when writing pseudocode, as a program in pseudocode is not an executable program.

**Five important rules for writing pseudocode are:**
**1.** Write one statement per line.
**2.** Initial keywords should be represented in capital case(READ, WRITE, IF, WHILE, UNTIL).
**3.** Indentation of pseudocode should be similar to the actual program to show hierarchy.
**4.** Ending the multiline structure is necessary.
**5.** Keep statements in simple language(English).

I will start another repository to complete the third assignment which is the pseudocode and flowchart.


### Koan
I took a break from reading and writing python codes for the final assignment and had a bit of fun with the Koans. Managed to complete 34 tasks! It was not easy and had to read up abit before I could understand what I was solving. But it has been fun doing the Koans. Can't say I have reached any level of enlightenment but I guess it is abit too early for that!


### Flowchart
Flowchart is part of the third assignment for this course. This also required some reading as I have never down a coding-centric flowcharts. I call it coding-centric as the symbols or shapes used to create the chart do actually carry certain meaning/function. So it is not as simple as putting in a cirle, or rhombus and arrows anyway you like. This was a good site to get some basic ideas about flowcharts :https://asana.com/resources/what-is-a-flowchart

So what is a flowchart? A Flowchart is visual representation of flow of a code or program. It uses standard symbols for input, output decisions and start stop statements. In a flowchart, we use certain shapes like box, circle and arrow. Flowcharts help us understand the code better.
