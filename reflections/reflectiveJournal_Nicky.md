# Reflective Journal

## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
What is Scratch explain?
Image result for what is scratch
Scratch is the world's largest coding community for children and a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital stories, games, and animations. Scratch is designed, developed, and moderated by the Scratch Foundation, a nonprofit organization.

### What is visual programming?
Visual programming is a programming language that lets humans describe processes using illustration. Whereas a typical text-based programming language makes the programmer think like a computer, a visual programming language enables the programmer to describe the process in terms that make sense to humans.

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
1. Keep It Simple, Stupid: most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex - Less code takes less time to write, has less bugs, and is easier to modify.
2. 

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
Recently I made my first game in Scratch : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/722400091
This was a lot of fun probably because it was visually immediate to see. And the overall learning curve was pretty good.
The coding process was easy as all the codes were there and it was just like working on a jigsaw puzzle.

## Week 2:

### What is git?
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 
While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.
I am also including the various youtube links I have been using to learn more about the topics covered in this class:

## Week 3:

### What is Visual Studio Code?
Visual Studio Code (famously known as VS Code) is a free open source text editor by Microsoft. VS Code is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Although the editor is relatively lightweight, it includes some powerful features that have made VS Code one of the most popular development environment tools in recent times.

Will install VS Code sometime this week. Not looking forward to this. It has been a steep learning curve with Python.

## Week 4:

### What is Videograph?
THis week was quite interesting. We learned about videograph. Roman asked us all to do a short recording of others based on several requirements. Then we had to show the video by all of us putting it down on the floor and playing the video at the same time. 



## Week 5:

### What is Stand-up?
Today we learned a little about a meeting tool called stand-up. A stand-up meeting (stum) is a meeting in which attendees typically participate while standing. The discomfort of standing for long periods is intended to keep the meetings short. We used this tool to briefly share idea(s) we have for our final project.
