#Write a Python program that calculatesa dog's age in dog's years.Note: For the first two years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years. After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.Your program should look as follows: 
#Input a dog's age in human years: 15                                    
#The dog's age in dog's years is 73

#1st 2 years of the dog = 21 years
#3 year onward is = (n-2)4 + 21
