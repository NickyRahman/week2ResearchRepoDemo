#Write a Python program that calculatesa dog's age in dog's years.Note: For the first two years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years. After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.Your program should look as follows: 
#Input a dog's age in human years: 15                                    
#The dog's age in dog's years is 73

#1st 2 years of the dog = 21 years
#3 year onward (n) is = (n-2)4 + 21

dogYears = int (input ("How old is the dog?"))
if dogYears < 0:
  print ("Dog years must be a positive number!")
  exit ()
elif dogYears <= 2:
  humanAge = dogYears * 10.5
  print ("The age of the dog is (humanAge) years in human years.")
else:
  humanAge = 21 + (dogYears - 2) * 4
  
print (f"The age of the dog is (humanAge) years, in human years.")
