#Write a Python program to convert month name to a number of days.
#Your program should look as follows: 

Input the name of Month: February 
No. of days: 28/29 days 


print("List of months: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December")
month_name - input ("Input the name of Month:")

if month_name == "February"
  print ("No. of days: 28/29 days")
elif month_name in ("April", "June", "September", "November"):
  print ("No. of days: 30 days")
elif month_name in ("January", "March", "May", "July", "August", "October", "December"):
  print ("No. of days: 31 days")
else:
  print ("Wrong month name")
