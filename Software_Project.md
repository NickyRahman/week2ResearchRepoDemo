This file contains all the source code for the Final Project.
27.08.2022 - Research. I will be spending some time and going to through a few sample of games developed using python. 
I have a found a useful website at https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-projects-for-beginners/
The site has many tutorials and options for those who are new to Python and coding.


## DAY 01
### Python Practice
Spent 22 hours practicing **Python coding** at https://www.dataquest.io/path/python-basics-for-data-analysis/
I have found this site to be very useful. The instructions are easy and explain all the basics of Python very clearly.

As I was writing the entries today, I realised my markdown formats were not rendering correctly. Started looking around what could possibly be the issue.
Turns out, when I created the file I did not give it the *.md extension* (the markdown extension). Learning so much from these entries!


## DAY 02
### Python Practice
Spent another 1 hour today doing Python exercises and Python Koan (continued from earlier class session). Didn't get through much. Hopefully can get a decent amount finished by Friday.

### FIGMA
Googled a couple of videos on FIGMA for web development and games. I think I might go this route instead of creating a python game. I feel this might benefit me more in the long run. While continuing with my Python practices.


## DAY 03
### Python Turtle Practice
I have decided to stick to Python for my final Software Project. I have decided to use Turtle as I have some experience using it. The idea is to generate simple grpahics usign Python Turtle for the exhibition. I have spent several hours the last few days looking at tutorials and refreshing my knowledge on Python Turtle.

Today I made a constellation of stars!!


## DAY 04
### Python Coding Practice
I have been spending some time doing basic Python coding Python Ocidng for Data Science. These set of tutorials have been very helpful in breaking down the 'language', making it easier for me to read coding lines, especially the ones in our Koans exercises. ALthough I have made some progress with the Koans, I have found a loop that has been helping me figure out the answers, I still don't understand the codes. These Data science python coding exercises have helped erase some of those confusions.


## DAY 05
### Brainstorming vs Flowchart
A lot to cover today. Started the day with more coding practice. We also discussed what brainstorming is and how it is different from a flowchart.

Brainstorming is about **capturing all the keywords that is related to or might be used in your program/app/game, etc**. You jot down these words and try to find connections between them, and then visualise them.

A Brainstorm is a diagram used to map associated ideas, words, images and concepts together. Brainstorms are also a tool and method for idea generation, finding associations, classifying ideas, organising information, visualising structure and a general aid to studying (Google).

A flowchart is a visual diagram that demonstrates the **FLOW of your program/app/game, etc**.

A flowchart is a diagram that illustrates the steps, sequences, and decisions of a process or workflow. While there are many different types of flowcharts, a basic flowchart is the simplest form of a process map. Itâ€™s a powerful tool that can be used in multiple fields for planning, visualizing, documenting, and improving processes (https://asana.com/resources/what-is-a-flowchart).

Continued my Python grpahics tutorial. Made a Spiral with rainbow hue!
