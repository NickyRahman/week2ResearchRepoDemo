### 1. Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
So.. I just realised we needed to do this repository from one of my classmates! I don't know if I have time to LOOK AWAY condsidering this needs to be submitted TOMORROW! Am going to try my best to finish as much as possible.


### 2. What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
Contrary to most productivity practices where an individual takes on a task and works at it until completion, timeboxing is a time management technique that limits a task to a fixed (but realistic) timeline that may be minutes, hours, days, or even weeks long, depending on the task complexity (https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/what-is-timeboxing)

### 3. On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
For the Research Repository, I am fairly confident I can do it, so maybe a 4. I just did not read the assignment properly so I had been filling up my Reflective journal instead of both the **Reflective Journal Repo** and the **Research Repo**. For the Software project tiself, I would say about 3-ish?

### 4. What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
I am struggling, but I am enjoying the course. I was very proud of my progress with the Koans coding. I was stuck, and didn't know what to do. Managed to do some research online and figurd out how to fix the prolems and move on with the Koans. So that was really morale-boosting for me.

### 5. Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 
I have been struggling with finding a proper strategy. Time management has been a huge issue for me. But I have been trying to make time for me at night as day time is filled with personal errands and responsibility. But i try to keep at least 2-3 hours at night to complete the appropriate readings, practice time and assignments.

### 6. If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
I would say **Start with the Learning Module**. Been trying to catch up on my reading for this course, and I have learned a lot! Which has helped me to complete this repo and the assignments for this course.

### 7. What is Python?
Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems. (Google search)

### 8. Have you developed a habit of exploring?
Yes. I always have had a particular habit of exploring new things I have learned or heard. First thing I do is go to Google to search keywords, and go on from there.

### 9. Have you meditated before?
I have tried meditating during my yoga classes. I don't think I've been doing it right, because I definitely do not come out of it 'calmer' or more 'collected'. LOL!

### 10. Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?
Digital Painting. I am proud of the fact that  picked this up from trial and error and looking at tutorials online. It took a lot of practice. And Lockdown in 2020 was the perfect time for me to master this skill. I came up with several finished digital paintings during the lockdown.

### 11. Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
Aboslutely not! I have done python before but they were very much guided learning sessions. leave me alone and I will get lost!

### 12. Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
Yes, very much! I think creativity is a valuable tool for learning to think logically. Many people assume creativity is restricted to art, but it is not. Creativity is applicable in all aspect of life. 

### 13. How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
19 tabs open. 19-0
All tabs are related to study. Sad, I know.

### 14. Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?
Yes. It can be frustrating when you don't know how the tech works. But usually I am able to overcome it by applying my knowledge on something similar to the new tech. Or I will google it up and figur it out from there.

### 15. What is an IDE?
An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI). An IDE typically consists of **Source code editor**, **Local build automation**, and **Debugger**. Visual Studio Code can be classed as an integrated development environment (IDE), meaning that developers can write and test code at the same time.

### 16. What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge?
I learned about **MVP**. Minimum viable product (MVP) development is a way to verify business assumptions for custom software or test the demand for a new product with minimum investments. A minimum viable product (MVP) is a concept from Lean Startup that stresses the impact of learning in new product development. MVP programming helps you to produce an actual product.

### 17. Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?
We had many blocks during this challenge. We approaching it from a very different way, where we starte from the foundation of the structure, instead of looking for the fastest and quickest way to stabilise the marshmallow.

### 18. So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
Picking up new terminologies and scripting.

### 19. What is OOP?
**OOP** stands for **Object Oriented Programming**, a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python (https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming). 

### 20. Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?
Yes, I am. I am going through the Learning Modules and referring to the Assignments, the Announcements and chats/commets left by students and Tutors.
I find the Canvas quite helpful especially with the documentations and modules for the courses I am taking.

### 21. Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
I did not find any part part of the course too tedious. Sure, some parts are hard to grasp, but it just required me to do extra learning and practicing.

### 22. What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface. Each type can provide its own independent implementation of this interface (https://stackify.com/oop-concept-polymorphism/).

### 23. Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?


### 24. What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
**MVP** stands for **minimum viable product**. A minimum viable product (MVP) is a development technique in which a new product or website is developed with sufficient features to satisfy early adopters. The final, complete set of features is only designed and developed after considering feedback from the product's initial users.
Explaining to a 6 year old,.. I HAVE NO IDEA...

### 25. What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?
Explaining MVP to 6-year olds.

### 26. What is pair programming?
**Pair programming** is an agile **software development technique** in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the **driver**, writes code while the other, the **observer or navigator**, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently (Wikipedia).

### 27. What are you looking forward to learning about programming?
Coding in Python, building games and websites.

### 28. What is conscious listening?

### 29. What is a variable?

### 30. What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?

### 31. What is something kind that someone has done for you?

### 32. If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?

### 33. Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?

### 34. What is a fixed mindset?

### What is something kind you have done for someone else?
